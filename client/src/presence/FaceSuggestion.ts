/**
 * Ethereal face layer — a low-poly face mesh at extreme transparency.
 * Not recognizable from distance; at close range, the impression
 * of human features emerges from light.
 *
 * TODO: Phase 2 implementation
 * - Low-poly face mesh (200-400 vertices)
 * - Positioned at head tracking location within particle cloud
 * - Extreme alpha (0.05-0.15 opacity)
 * - Face pixels blend with surrounding particle colors
 * - Vertex displacement "breathing" with particle cloud
 * - Screen-space effect may work better than geometry
