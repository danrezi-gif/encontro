# Encontro — Design Vision

## Phenomenological Targets

### The space should feel like:
- A clear night in the desert — vast but intimate
- The inside of a cathedral made of darkness
- Being underwater in bioluminescent waters
- The moment before sleep when boundaries soften

### Encountering another should feel like:
- Seeing a campfire from across a dark field
- Hearing someone humming a melody you almost recognize
- The warmth of sitting next to someone in comfortable silence
- The moment in MDMA when you look at someone and think "I see you, I actually see you"

### Merging should feel like:
- Two candle flames touching
- Harmonizing voices finding each other
- The moment a hug becomes real (when you stop performing it)
- Breathing in sync without trying

### After the ceremony:
- Quiet, warm, slightly changed
- Carrying something of the other person
- Like waking from a meaningful dream
- The afterglow

## Anti-Targets (What This Is NOT)

- **NOT a social platform** (no profiles, no followers, no messaging)
- **NOT a game** (no scores, no achievements, no progression)
- **NOT a simulation** (no realistic environments, no physics)
- **NOT a metaverse** (no persistent world, no avatar customization)
- **NOT therapy** (no facilitator intervention, no processing structure)

**It IS a ceremony space. A place for encounter. Nothing more.**

## Visual Language

### Presences (Luminous Beings)
- GPU particle clouds: 2,000-5,000 particles each
- Gaussian distribution: dense core, diffuse edges
- Organic breathing rhythm (sinusoidal scale oscillation)
- HSL color that shifts slowly over time
- Soft alpha falloff from center
- Velocity-responsive: faster = more dispersed

### Environment (The Dark Meadow)
- Nearly black: most illumination comes from presences themselves
- Bioluminescent ground that responds to proximity
- Particle-based cosmic sky dome
- Subtle fog that shifts with ceremony phase
- No walls, no ceiling — infinite dark space

### Merge Visual
- Additive blending of particle systems
- Particles cross ownership boundaries
- Unified color palette at full merge
- Post-merge: each carries a color trace of the other

### Ethereal Face (Phase 2)
- Low-poly face mesh at extreme transparency (0.05-0.15)
- Not recognizable from distance
- At close range: impression of human features emerges from light
- Never sharp — always soft, suggested, dreaming

## Audio Language

### Ambient Soundscape
- Generative, never exactly repeating
- Evolves with ceremony phase
- Warm, enveloping, non-intrusive

### Tone Signatures
- Each user's movement generates unique harmonic series
- Slow movement = low frequencies, active = higher
- Smooth = pure tones, jerky = more harmonics

### Harmonic Resonance
- When two signatures approach: ring modulation creates new frequencies
- Sum/difference tones that neither produces alone
- The sonic equivalent of "seeing each other"

### Spatial Audio
- HRTF-based 3D positioning
- Hear others from their location
- In merge state: binaural centered (you're "inside" each other)
